/**
 * Fails on any declaration this package never reads.
 *
 * `npm run check-unused` — part of `verify`.
 *
 * This is `tsc --noUnusedLocals`, and it is a script rather than a
 * `tsconfig.json` setting for one reason: **core ships raw TypeScript**, so
 * `node_modules/@moba2d/core/src/**` is part of this package's program and
 * `noUnusedLocals` reports on it too. Core's unused locals are core's to fix,
 * and a pack whose typecheck goes red because of them is a pack that will
 * turn the rule off. Filtering by path keeps the compiler's exact answer and
 * scopes the verdict to the files this repository owns.
 *
 * Why every pack gets this. On the largest pack there is, nothing ever asked,
 * and 1968 dead declarations accumulated in `spells/` — type aliases and value
 * aliases emitted per file by a codemod, none of them read by anything. That
 * is not a formatting complaint: it is what made those files read as machine
 * output rather than as written code, and it buried the ~40 lines per file
 * that are actually the ability. A spell file is the thing a human or an agent
 * reads to learn how this pack writes abilities, so it is worth keeping
 * readable.
 *
 * It catches ordinary things too, which is the real payoff: an import of a
 * constant a test stopped using, a `{ from, to }` destructure reading a half
 * nobody wants, a private field nothing touches, a value computed inside a
 * `draw()` and then dropped.
